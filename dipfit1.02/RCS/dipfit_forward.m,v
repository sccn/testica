@% dipfit_forward() - compute potential of a multiple dipole model
%
% Usage: 
%  >> pot = dipfit_forward(dip, elc, vol, varargin)
%
% Inputs:
%   model	dipole model for single component, can include multiple dipoles
%   elc		electrode positions
%   vol		volume conductor model
%
% Output:
%   pot		potential distribution of this model
