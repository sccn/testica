@% dipfit_relvar() - compute relative residual variance between model and data
%                   for a single component. Only active dipoles are used to 
%                   compute the model potential.
%
% Usage: 
%  >> rv = dipfit_relvar(model, data, elc, vol, varargin)
%
% Inputs:
%   data	single ICA component
%   model	dipole model for this component, can include multiple dipoles
%   elc		electrode positions
%   vol		volume conductor model
%
% Output:
%   rv		relative residual variance of dipole model

% convert the optional arguments into a structure, which is easier to handle
if nargin>4
  optarg = struct(varargin{:});
else
  optarg = [];
end

% ensure that the data is average referenced
data = avgref(data);

% compute the potential distribution of all active, unselected dipoles
pot_model = dipfit_forward(model, elc, vol);

% compute relative residual variance
rv = relvar(data, pot_model);
